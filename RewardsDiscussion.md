![Rewards](https://github.com/PeopleManagers/managers/blob/master/manager-toolkit/Assets/AnnualRew-Banner.png)

Every Hubber wants to be recognized and rewarded for their work. At GitHub we have a [Total Rewards philosphy](https://thehub.github.com/hr/total-rewards/#our-total-rewards-philosophy) that includes a variety of elements important to Hubbers including a competitive market salary, equity, bonus, comprehensive benefits and more. As a manager you are pivotal in making sure we recognize and reward your Hubbers for the impact they have on the team, business and customers. **The information below will give you a general understanding of the annual rewards process and point you to more detailed information, if applicable.**  Additionally, there are two [compensation basic videos, Annual Bonus and Base Pay](https://github.rewatch.com/collection/5884/topic-library), that you may find useful.  

üí™ **Impact:** At GitHub we hire the best people and help them do great work and to thrive. It's the responsibility of every manager to provide ongoing feedback, both about what Hubbers are doing well and the areas where they need to improve. We reward Hubbers based on their impact and show recognition and appreciation as a key part of the GitHub culture. At GitHub, we define a Hubber‚Äôs impact as the combination of **results and behaviors** on team, business, and customer results. Simply put, what one does and how they do it.  In determining impact we look at three interrelated factors: 
* A Hubber‚Äôs individual accomplishments that contribute to team, business or customer results
* A Hubber‚Äôs results and how they built on the work, ideas, or efforts of others
* A Hubber‚Äôs contributions to the success of others

## Annual Rewards Process ‚≠ê üí∞
Annual Rewards are one way that we recognize impact. GitHub‚Äôs performance philosophy supports differentiated rewards for differentiated impact; we give higher rewards to those with higher impact for the year. Individual contribution is evaluated based on a Hubber‚Äôs impact, which is a combination of results and behaviors for the full fiscal year. At the end of each fiscal year, managers assess the impact of their Hubbers and develop a rewards % recommendation which directly influences annual rewards including merit, bonus, and stock (based on eligibility). For more information on Total Rewards, see [Total Rewards Program](https://thehub.github.com/hr/total-rewards/#our-total-rewards-program) on The Hub.<br>

The Annual Rewards process consists of three primary components as outlined below. It is important to note that the Year-end Reflection process and Annual Rewards process take place in parallel. Although they influence each other, they are two distinct activities each with their own distinct components. For more informaton on the Year-end Reflection process, see [Reflections](https://github.com/PeopleManagers/managers/blob/master/manager-toolkit/People%20Processes/reflections.md) in the Manager Toolkit.

 ## Determining Impact Recommendation 
Impact is determined by the results and behaviors for a given fiscal year, July 1 - June 30. Use the steps below to help determine the impact your employees had during the fiscal year to to recomend impact-based rewards. 

*Select the triangle to expand the content.*

<details><summary><strong>Step 1 - Learn what Impact means and how it relates to Rewards </strong></summary>

<br>  
Performance is about an employee's impact on team, business or customer results and our annual rewards are based on impact. The biggest impact can be achieved through a successful combination of three inter-related factors as outlined in the graphic below.<br>
<br>
  
<p align="center">
<img width="800" src="https://github.com/PeopleManagers/managers/blob/master/manager-toolkit/Assets/Impact%20Circles.png">
</p>
<br>
Consider all three of these factors holistically when thinking about an employee's impact. Do not assign weights, points, or
other formulas to mathematically try to derive impact. How the three dimensions show up may vary by employee based on
their role and on specific work, but evidence of all three should be considered when determining impact and recommending a rewards percentage.<br>
  
Impact for the fiscal year includes how each employee delivered results across all three circles of impact in alignment with our [Leadership Princples](https://thehub.github.com/github/#leadership-principles) and [Standards of Busineess Conduct](https://thehub.github.com/hr/policies/handbooks/employees/#standards-of-conduct).
  
</details>

<details><summary><strong>Step 2 - Understand the Difference Between Impact and Activity</strong></summary>

<br>  
Successful performance is based on impact (what you accomplish), not activity (how busy you might be). The examples below
differentiate activity from the resulting impact and may represent outcomes that align with critical indicators of success listed in
the employee‚Äôs core priorities. Each represents an impact to the team, business, or customer - and whether positive or
negative, each can help managers coach an employee for greater impact and provide context for reward recommendations.<br>
<br>
      
Activity | ‚ûî | Impact
-- | -- | --
Met with 6 customers | ‚ûî |  Customer meetings helped close $X in new revenue or upsell.
Delivered 2 Conference Talks | ‚ûî | Conference Talks received X satisfaction rating and increased positive impression of GitHub, resulting in positive story from influencer.
Shipped 3 features | ‚ûî | Feature X contributed to MEU increase by...<br> Feature Y increased enterprise adoption by...<br> Feature Z saved time, higher quality
Root caused 2 outages | ‚ûî | RCA resulted in 2 learnings, changed process, prevented future issues
Joined a Community of Belonging (CoB) | ‚ûî | After joining a CoB, attended the Ability Summit. Organized a session for my team to share some of the learnings/best practices and it was well received. Have seen team members become more inclusive both in-person and in product design. Project ‚ÄòADAW‚Äô is a brainchild of this session
Implemented new process | ‚ûî | New process saved 6 steps, removed 2 approvals and estimated time savings of 2 days.

  
</details>

<details><summary><strong>Step 3 - Consider the Impact of Employee Relative to Opportunity for Impact</strong></summary>

<br>  
Opportunity for impact represents the full range of what might be delivered in support of business needs, and the expectation
of how it will delivered as a part of a team. <br>

We determine rewards based on the impact employees have. In any given year there are different degrees of impact across
different employees, as well as different opportunities to have impact. Employees can work with their manager using 1:1‚Äôs and
Reflections through-out the year to align on primary areas of focus and expected opportunity for impact to team, business or
customer.
<br>
  
**When there is a need to reset expectations:**  Working in a dynamic environment means that business needs or employee
circumstances may change. As such, expectations and an employee‚Äôs opportunity for impact can also change each year and
sometimes during the year. An employee or their manager might recommend making a change to the employee‚Äôs priorities
and related expectations. Any change should be discussed and agreed upon in an employee‚Äôs 1:1‚Äôs and Reflections through-out
the year.<br>
  
When considering rewards, reflect on how that employee delivered impact aligned to those revised expectations. If their
opportunity for impact increased, you may find that their impact also increased. If their circumstances changed and their
opportunity for impact is lower, then their resulting impact may also be lower. It‚Äôs important that you **remember to consider
your employee‚Äôs contributions for the full fiscal year and ensure your rewards recommendation represents impact
before and after any changes in circumstances.** Some considerations may include:<br>
  
* Did they deliver strong results during the earlier part of the year? Be aware of and mitigate potential recency bias by
considering multiple sources to ensure a balanced assessment.
* If work needed to shift, did they deliver impact against revised expectations?
* Were they proactive in working to reset priorities, and did they leverage you and others for additional help and support?
* Were they able to contribute to the success of others with the shift in priorities?
* If the opportunity for impact increased or decreased, did they deliver impact aligned to the new opportunity?
* How did they deliver results throughout the year? Was it consistent with our culture?
<br>
 
**When impact is not yet known:** Since reward decisions may occur before the final impact of your employees' work on a
given project has been realized (because not all projects end with the fiscal year), consider the incremental impact in terms of
contribution to milestones. Some considerations would include the following:<br>
  
* What critical milestones have been achieved in pursuit of the final outcome, and how has the work been accomplished?
* How has the project improved along the way based on learnings from earlier work that have been applied?
* Can you reasonably assume intended impact based on quality of work?
* Is the project on track for reasonable probability of that impact? Is it continuing work? If so, were some milestones
reached that have impact to the project/work/product itself?<br>
  
**When the work is innovative and the potential usage or application may not yet be known:** Some considerations
would include the following:<br>
  
* Is the work seen as worthy of taking forward and exploring application?
* Is this a breakthrough? Does this build on the work of others, and/or contribute to the success of others?
* Were there learnings that will have an impact on the employee, the team, or others in a positive way?
* Is there a clear path forward with milestones or measurable outcomes to remain accountable for the work and
exploration?
 
</details>

<details><summary><strong>Step 4 - Consider the Impact of Your Hubbers</strong></summary>

<br> 
  There are three primary sources of information you should take into account to fully understand the impact your direct
report(s) had during the course of the year:<br>
  
* Reflections
* Formal and informal feedback
* Your overall observations (1:1's, day-to-day)
<br>
  
**Remember**
* The biggest impact at GitHub is achieved through a successful combination of the [three interrelated factors](https://github.com/PeopleManagers/managers/blob/master/manager-toolkit/Assets/Impact%20Circles.png). It is
imperative that managers reflect on not just the individual's accomplishments, but also on how they leveraged the work
of others and contributed to others' results and the impact gained. Take into account missed opportunities to use
others' work or ideas, and to have broader impact by contributing to others' results.
* While there is a fixed rewards budget, we do not have a pre-determined distribution. There is no curve or targeted
distribution for which employees are competing for a targeted number of slots in a percentage pay-out bucket.
Managers should focus on impact, not budget when recommending rewards. As the model rolls up to leaders,
they may shift recommendations to meet budget with consultation with the managers
on the team.

</details>

<details><summary><strong>Step 5 - Be Aware of Potential Bias and Mitigate</strong></summary>
<br> 
  As you are assessing impact, activate strategies to mitigate potential bias
<br>
    
Bias | What it is | How to Mitigate
-- | -- |--
Recency | You may tend to focus on impact recently delivered or missed, rather than all impact delivered over the entire fiscal year. | Consider multiple sources when determining impact to ensure a balanced assessment. Potential sources include: Reflections, feedback, and overall observations from the whole fiscal year
Confirmation | You may look for information that aligns to and strengthens your current beliefs. For example, viewing someone positively or negatively based on a previous rewards. | Collect all evidence and reasoning before identifying your stance. When collecting feedback from others, pay close attention to feedback which confirms or goes against your beliefs. For year over year performance.
Similarity | You may respond more favorably to characteristics you like about yourself that you identify in others, including how someone communicates, their work patterns, and how they think. | Practice willful awareness and consciously reflect on what might be impacting your assessment. Ask yourself, ‚ÄúHow is this person similar to or different from me? Is that affecting how I think about their impact?
Proximity | You may have a positive or negative bias due to perceived availability. For example, perceiving an employee in a different time zone or remote location as driving lower impact. | Performance expectations do not change based on work site, location, or hours. Rewards should focus on impact not hours in the office/online. Acknowledge how time and experiences with each employee may impact how you are assessing an individual‚Äôs performance.

</details>

<details><summary><strong>Step 6 - Consider your Overall Observations about Your Hubbers - Questions to Ask Yourself</strong></summary>
<br> 
  
For each employee, consider both the impact they had and the opportunities for even greater impact. Ask yourself the following questions: 
1. How did the employee's individual accomplishments **impact the team, business, or customer?**
  * How did they deliver against results relative to their opportunity? (more, same, less)
  * Did they successfully drive what they set out to do? 
  * What proportion of their effort was spent on activity that yielded little or no impact?
  * Did they take appropriate risks? Did they look for new ways of doing things to produce stronger results?
  * Did they take accountability for any mistakes, and then apply what they learned to improve their work going forward?
  * What other opportunities were there for impact through individual accomplishments? What prevented those opportunities from being realized?<br>
  
2. How did they **leverage others** (ideas, code, experience, process, connections, and so on) *to increase the impact of
their work?*
  * How did they seek out and leverage teammates, peers or teams? How did this impact their work?
  * Was their approach effective in enhancing their results? What was the impact?
  * What more could they have done to leverage others? What would the impact have been if they had done this?
  * What prevented those opportunities from being realized?<br>
  
3. How did they **contribute to others' results** (by sharing their ideas, code, experience, process, connections, and so on)?
  * How did they seek out opportunities to help others, or respond to requests for help quickly or thoughtfully?
  * How did they invest time, energy, or insights to help others in and outside their teams? 
  * Were they effective in having broader impact by contributing to others? **What was the impact?**
  What is different (for the team, org, prgram, GitHub) due to their contributions? 
  * What more could they have done to contribute to others? What would the impact have been if they had done this? What prevented those opportunities from being realized?<br>
  
4. How did they continue to increase their impact through **learning and growth?**
  * How did they proactively recognize missed opportunities for greater impact? Did they learn from this and take differentactions subsequently?
  * Did they successfully apply feedback and learning? If yes, how did you observe this and what was the result?
  * Did they actively seek out opportunities to learn from others or to make others better? Was it effective? In what way?<br>
  
5. How did they actively contribute to creating a more **diverse and inclusive work environment** 
  * Were they intentional about seeking and including input from other teams, team members, or colleagues?
  * Did they work to incorporate diverse perspectives into the work they produced? What was the impact?
  * Did they proactively address misunderstandings and disagreements? What was the result?

</details>

<details><summary><strong>Step 7 - Consider Unique Hubber Circumstances</strong></summary>
<br>
  
* **Employees who had a change in role, team, or manager during the year:** Base your impact determination on the entire fiscal year, being careful not to focus disproportionately on the time that you have been the employee's manager. Review the Reflections completed by the employee and their previous manager(s) and any feedback collected earlier in the year. To make sure you have a good understanding of prior impact and contributions, set up time to speak with the prior manager
so you have the full context.
  <br>
  
* **Employees who worked less than a full year:** For employees who joined GitHub part way through the fiscal year, or took a leave of absence, be sure to consider impact only the period for which they were actively working and do not penalize them for the time they were not at work. This includes employees who have taken a leave of absence protected by law (for example, military leave, maternity or parental leave, disability leave, or leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act). 
  <br>
  
</details>

<details><summary><strong>Step 8 - Determine Impact and Make Reward Percentage Recommendation</strong></summary>
<br>
Go to the Rewards tool in Workday and select from the drop-down a percentage payout reccomendation based on your Hubber's impact. (See a demo of the Rewards tool [here]()) Take into consideration the following:
  
<br>
  
Make **lower recommendation** for employees with acceptable overall performance, but where one or more of the following are true:
  * Delivered less impact to the team, business, or customer than expected
  * Accomplishments were less impactful than expected
  * Missed opportunities to increase quality of their results and impact through leveraging others
  * Missed opportunities to broaden their own impact by contributing to others' success
  * Development or progress in role, while steady, is slower than expected
  * Did not represent the Leadership Principles or support our goals of creating a more diverse and inclusive work environment. 

<br>
  
Make **higher recommendations** for employees with particularly high impact results where most or all of the following are true:
  * High resulting impact for the team, business or customer
  * High quality accomplishments that yielded exceptionally strong impact
  * Deepened their results and impact by actively seizing opportunities to leverage others
  * Applied and represented our Leadership Principles 
  * Contributed to creating a more diverse and inclusive environment 
  * Broadened their own impact by actively seizing opportunities to contribute to the success of others
  * Deepened their impact on GitHub through involvement and participation outside of their role (CoB, developer relations, etc.)
  * Demonstrated meaningful learning and growth that resulted in increasingly created impact

  *Note: If you have any organizations below you, you cannot submit until your managers have submitted their recommendations up to you.*

## Manager's Role in Annual Rewards
We expect managers to lead by example, engage proactively and work together. To show great care throughout the process and demonstrate strength of character as role models for culture, leadership principles, and our commitment to diversity, inclusion and belonging. Managers need to be empathetic to each Hubber‚Äôs unique situation when they determine impact making sure they:

<p align="center">
  <img width="800" src="https://github.com/PeopleManagers/managers/blob/master/manager-toolkit/Assets/ManagerRole1.PNG">
</p>
<br>

**Managers are responsible in the Annual Rewards cycle for:**

* Determining impact for each Hubber on their team
* Assigning an Impact percentage recommendation in Workday for each Hubber on their team
* Providing a Reward Justification in Workday for each Hubber on their team that supports the Impact percentage recommendation
* Actively participates in Impact Discussions to establish benchmarks for each grade in their function
* Making any adjustments to impact percentage recommendations based on benchmarks and communicating those adjustments to managers that did not participate in Impact Discussions
* Hold Rewards Discussion with each of their Hubbers

If you are a manager of managers ‚Äì review the [Manager of Manager Quick Guide](https://github.com/PeopleManagers/managers/blob/master/manager-toolkit/People%20Processes/leader-guide.md) for specific actions you can take to
effectively support Annual Rewards.

## Impact Discussion
Impact Discussions are annual structured conversations between managers and their organizational leader to provide broader visibility of impact within teams and across the function. By sharing examples of Hubber‚Äôs delivering higher and lower impact, managers establish benchmark impact examples for their organization. Managers leverage these benchmark conversations to identify themes and make (or refine) impact recommendations that inform employees‚Äô annual rewards. Note: These are not discussions on budget or an exercise to ensure ratings meet a budget amount. They are also not discussions about each individual. Rather, an opportunity to create/agree on function specific impact benchmarks for different grade levels. 

Depending on the function, some front line managers may not participate in the Impact Discussions. However, all managers are still required to provide an impact percentage recommendation in Workday for each of their Hubbers. Impact Discussions are coordinated by the organization‚Äôs HR Business Partner. Below are questions to ask yourself to prepare for the Impact Discussion. Managers will receive function-specific instructions for the Impact Discussion from their manager and/or HR Business Partner.  

<details><summary><strong>Primary outcomes of the Impact Discussion</strong></summary>

<br> 

* Complete in depth conversations about impact to define a common understanding of higher and lower impact within the context of your team or organization.
* Align on and establish impact benchmarks (higher, lower, and expected) for your team and organization using examples. Since not all employees are discussed, the benchmarks are used by managers to inform their impact (rewards) recommendations.
* Discuss which employees in the organization had the highest impact. Focus on how the impact (results and behaviors) was achieved using examples.
* Provide visibility to recommendations for zero rewards.
* Generate collective views on promotion recommendations.
<br>

 </details> 
  
<details><summary><strong>Questions to prepare for the Impact Discussion</strong></summary>

<br> 

<br>
The following questions can help you prepare for Impact Discussions. You can also leverage them to foster a deeper conversation on how the impact is defined across the broader organization. 

<br>

**Focus on Results and Behaviors**
- [ ] How did their performance reflect the impact on the team, business, or customer results across: (1) Individual accomplishments; (2) Contributions to the success of others; and (3) Results that built on the work or ideas of others
- [ ] How consistently did they exhibit the behaviors we need?
      [ ] Standards of Conduct - acting ethically and responsibly
      [ ] Leadership Principles - showing them in everyday interactions
      [ ] Inclusive Behaviors - incorporating practices that create an inclusive culture 
- [ ] What information did others share (Formal, informal feedback, customer feedback, etc.) as examples of Results and Behaviors?   

**Revisit Priorities**
- [ ] How did they deliver against their priorities?
- [ ] If a manager, how did they deliver success through their team?  How did they consistently apply the Manager Fundamentals? 

**Consider the Impact Delivered**
- [ ] How did they deliver results relative to their opportunity?
- [ ] Did they successfully drive what they set out to do?
- [ ] Where can they develop to increase their impact?
- [ ] How did they consistently demonstrate the behaviors of employees?

**Reflect on Contribution to Others**
- [ ] How did they make others great?
- [ ] How did they seek out and leverage teammates, peers, or teams?
- [ ] What is different (for the team, function, program, and GitHub) due to their contributions?
- [ ] How did they invest time, energy, mentorships or insights to help others?
- [ ] If a manager, how did they demonstrate effective management of their teams?  

**Consider all Opportunities for Impact**
- [ ]  If work shifted, how did they deliver impact against revised priorities?
- [ ]  Did they proactively reset priorities, and leverage you and others for additional support?
- [ ]  Were they able to contribute to others‚Äô success with the shift in priorities?
- [ ]  If the opportunity for impact increased or decreased, did they deliver impact against this new opportunity?

**Questions for Promotion Considerations**
- [ ] Business Need: where has your team‚Äôs scope or work expanded?  Which roles will be taking on this expanded scope?
- [ ] Who has shown the impact that demonstrates they are ready for and would be successful in a role with greater scope and responsibility?
- [ ] How have they shown impact aligned with our culture and leadership principles?
- [ ] For manager promotions, how have they demonstrated the Manager Fundamentals (Model, Coach, Care), expectations of managers?
- [ ] Is their budget available?
- [ ] If it is decided that an individual is not ready for a promotion, what development areas do they need to focus on?  How will you support them? 

 </details>

<details><summary><strong>Manager's role before, during and after the Impact Discussion</strong></summary>

<br>


**Before Impact Discussion**
- [ ] Gather information from the full fiscal year to determine impact
- [ ] Submit initial impact % recommendation and justification  in Workday.  The impact % decision drives payout for bonus, equity, and merit
- [ ] Prepare to share impact examples during the discussion
- [ ] Be ready to discuss each team member‚Äôs impact.
- [ ] Submit promotion recommendation and justification, if applicable
<br>

**During Impact Discussion**
- [ ] Focus on impact, for the full fiscal year
- [ ] Share examples of high and low impact - consider all [three circles](https://github.com/PeopleManagers/managers/blob/master/manager-toolkit/Assets/Impact%20Circles.png)
- [ ] Establish and align on benchmarks as a team/org
- [ ] Demonstrate Model, Coach, Care and inclusive behaviors
- [ ] Participate in the discussion
- [ ] Be present and engaged - demonstrate curiosity and exercise courage
- [ ] Be mindful of potential bias and work with others to help mitigate it
- [ ] Discuss promotion recommendations
<br>

**After Impact Discussion**
- [ ] Make adjustments, as necessary in Workday  (impact %) to align with the impact benchmarks for your org<br>
*Communicate*
- [ ] If a manager didn‚Äôt attend the impact discussion, their manager is expected to: 
- [ ] Share themes and examples  of  higher/target/lower impact
- [ ] Ensure alignment to benchmarks
- [ ] If edits were made, to a manager‚Äôs recommendation be sure to communicate the change and rationale

## Record Impact: Annual Rewards Workflow in the Workday Rewards Tool üèÅ

The following Annual Rewards Walk-Thru videos that guide you through the experience of conducting Annual Rewards in Workday: we have two separate videos that reflect the UX in the different Manager levels defined below:

[Impact Manager Walk-Thru](https://github.rewatch.com/video/wy1guelan32uqze2-annual-rewards-impact-manager?t=0)
 - Definition of Impact Manager: IC Manager (M1) or Manager of Manager‚Äôs and ICs (M2) with org size of 20 or less

[Allocating Manager/Final Approver Walk-Thru](https://github.rewatch.com/video/k2vpfvgbmlb4ymht-annual-rewards-allocating-managers-and-final-approvers?t=251.19)
- Definition of Allocating Manager: All VPs, GMs, and M2s with org size of 21 or more
- Definition of Final Approver: Thomas Dohmke‚Äôs direct reports

We also have the following videos to assist Managers as it related to Annual Rewards: 
 - [Annual Rewards: Impact Distribution Report](https://github.rewatch.com/video/t911yppt3marfjxr-annual-rewards-impact-distribution-report)
 - [Annual Rewards Manager Boost 5.19.22](https://github.rewatch.com/video/96xpud3bjtggrkny-manager-boost-preparing-for-annual-rewards-promotions)
 - [How to Send a Review back for changes or Complete on Behalf of a Direct Report](https://github.com/github/business-systems/blob/master/H2R/Workday/Documentation/How%20to%20Send%20a%20review%20back%20for%20changes%20or%20Complete%20on%20behalf%20of%20a%20Direct%20Report.md)

We recommend taking a look at these to familiarize yourself with the tool and how the workflow will look and feel in the system.

We do encourage that Allocating Manager's watch the Impact Manager video so that they are familiar with the differences in the UX.

## Rewards Justification üìù
In the Workday Rewards tool, each manager is required to complete a rewards justification which is a brief description of the impact an employee had this past fiscal year that will be used to help provide context for the manager's impact recommendation. Managers complete a short summary for each of their direct reports that captures the key results and impact delivered through a combination of individual accomplishments, leveraging others, and contributing to others' success. The summary should include positive impact as well as any opportunities to have had more impact.<br>

The GitHub rewards philosophy supports differentiated rewards for differentiated impact. Therefore, be sure the summaries are as differentiated as the impact of the team members for the past year and reflect each individual's impact in all three areas (individual accomplishments, leveraging others' work, and contributing to others results). <br>

Once the rewards justification has been submitted, it cannot be edited unless your manager sends it back to you. The justification(s) are visible upward in the  reporting chain to provide insight on the basis for each recommendation. Subsequent managers in the reporting ladder may edit the summary as appropriate. If this happens, that manager should have a conversation with the Hubber's manager to discuss the changes. <br>

Keep in mind the rewards justification is not an end-of-year write-up or review and is neither visible to, nor intended to be shared with, employees. Managers should not request that employees summarize their impact for you. Instead, use information from Reflektives, 1:1 meetings, informal and formal feedback, and your observations in considering the impact an employee had over the past year. 
<br>
>
**Rewards Justification Example**
This example is to give you a sense for the expected length and the type of content included in a rewards justification. It is not intended to imply a specific impact or rewards recommendation. The Rewards Justification field has a 1,000-character limit and a 150 character minimum. This example is 950+ characters.
<br>
*Example*
<br>
* Provided input to a customer service initiative, which resulted in increased satisfaction in diverse customer populations utilizing Fabrikam.
* Contributed blueprint and experience to ATARIS team. Avoiding key pitfalls, reduced cost by $M.
* Fewer contributions than expected as extended core team member on Constoso - feedback cited missed opportunities to share proven best practices from Chicago that would have accelerated timeline.
* Actively applied learning from each project to the next. Agility + better methods = increased speed, quality, and higher partner satisfaction.
* Consistently exercised curiosity by seeking new perspectives from a variety of sources and applied insights to develop more inclusive solutions.
* People Management: Exceptional development of team through model, coach, and care, with visible technical skills and capability enhancement across team. Lost lead on Fabrikam (preventable and no backup in place), which resulted in delayed implementation. Didn't coach team to connect with others outside the immediate group and missed opportunity for team to get new ideas/improve efficiency. Schedule and quality not optimized as team reinvented work the FNP team had already done.

## Rewards Discussion üí∞ üåà

Rewards Discussions are brief 15-20 minute conversations between a manager and their Hubber during which the manager reflects on the impact the Hubber delivered over the past fiscal year and shares a summary of the Annual Rewards outcomes that are detailed in the employees snapshot.  

A Rewards Discussion is not a detailed review of all accomplishments over the last fiscal year nor is it a year-end performance review since the manager has had Reflection Conversations and 1:1 meetings with their Hubbers throughout the year to discuss impact.  
<br>

**Step 1:  Get Ready for the Rewards Discussion** 
<br>
**Step 2:  Communicate Rewards**
<br>

### Step 1: Get Ready for the Rewards Discussion :calendar: üìù
The best Rewards Discussions are those a manager is prepared to have. They may be straight forward or you may have to answer several questions and provide context for your Hubber. Difficult or not, just knowing how you plan to have the discussion and anticipating the questions you may be asked will put you on the road to success. Below are some recommended actions to take in preparation for your Rewards Discussion.

<details><summary><strong>Schedule the Rewards Discussion</strong></summary>
<br>
    
Schedule a date and time for each Rewards Discussion, ~20 minutes, and set expectations with your Hubbber about what the discussion will entail.  Managers are notified via email when Snapshots are made available, typically  mid-August.  Rewards Discussions should take place prior to mid-September when Snapshots are auto-released to employees or before September 1 if the employee is being promoted effective on that date.  Click here [Key Dates](https://github.com/PeopleManagers/managers/blob/master/manager-toolkit/People%20Processes/FY22Key-Dates.md) for key dates. 
When selecting a date for each discussion, ensure that you have allowed yourself adequate time to prepare before the discussion.  Consider scheduling a buffer of time between discussions in case you need extra time.

<details><summary><strong>View rewards outcomes in the Snapshot</strong></summary>
<br>

The Snapshot is a summary of the Rewards a Hubber has earned during the review timeframe. Prior to the Rewards Discussion, get the Hubber's Snapshot of their rewards from Workday. Refer to the [Key Dates](https://github.com/PeopleManagers/managers/blob/master/manager-toolkit/People%20Processes/FY22Key-Dates.md) to know when the Snapshots will be available in Workday. Review the Snapshot to make sure rewards are aligned to the payout percentage in the Workday Rewards tool that you expected. If there are significant discrepancies, reach out to your manager for clarification so you fully understand the final rewards outcome and you can own the message to your Hubber.<br>

The Snapshot is your primary tool in facilitating the Rewards Discussion. There are three different Snapshot views depending on the Hubber's role:
1. Salaried Hubber
2. Hourly Hubber
3. Sales Incentive Plan (quota carrying role) Hubber

For common Snapshot questions, see the [FAQ](https://github.com/PeopleManagers/managers/blob/master/performance-management/assets/main-FAQ.md).

</details>


<details><summary><strong>Gather and review available information</strong></summary>
<br>
As you are preparing for a rewards discussion with each employee:
* Consider the overall context of the employee's impact. If needed, re-review the Hubber's Reflections, formal and informal feedback, and your 1:1 meeting notes. <br>
* Look at the Snapshot to see the actual value of an employee's bonus, stock, and merit awards.

</details>


<details><summary><strong>Connect with your Manager</strong></summary>
<br>  
Set aside time to connect with your manager to ask any questions you may have in understanding or supporting the rewards outcomes. Remember to approach the conversation with curiosity, seeking to understand what you may not have seen. Consider the following discussion points: 
  
 *  What thematic guidance of higher and lower impact came out of Impact Discussions? 
  
 *  If the rewards outcome changed significantly from your recommendation, was it based on a different view of impact? Or was it based on how budget was allocated? <br>
 * What other information do you need to help demonstrate support for the outcomes? 
  
It is important that you understand the outcomes so that you can effectively own the rewards message; that is to represent the outcomes, and your role in reaching them. Research shows that one of the top indicators of an employee's satisfaction with their pay is that their manager had involvement and input into the process. <br>

Being prepared and helping your Hubbers understand how impact and budget considerations drove rewards across the organization will help the conversation go more smoothly and ideally help motivate your employees for the coming year.

</details>


<details><summary><strong>Own the Rewards Message</strong></summary>
<br>
    
As a manager, it is your responsibility to communicate the rewards outcome to your Hubbers and to support it. It is possible for the rewards outcomes to differ from your expectations. If that is the case, it is still important for you as the manager to understand the rewards outcome and own the rewards message. Make sure to connect with your manager to understand all the factors that went into the final rewards outcome. In preparation for the discussion, review the [Snapshot](https://github.com/github/business-systems/blob/master/H2R/Workday/Documentation/Rewards_Snapshot.md) for each of your Hubbers and prepare for potential questions they may ask. Reflect on what you need to communicate to support the rewards outcome. It's also a good idea to revisit the resources that you used to determine the Hubber‚Äôs impact for this rewards cycle - 1:1, reflection, feedback, etc.   
    
Research shows that an employee‚Äôs satisfaction with their pay is closely related to how much they believe their manager was involved and had input in the process. Help your Hubber understand the role you played in determining their impact and recommending their rewards payout percentage.  
NOTE: If you were not their manager at times of the rewards discussion, then ensure you are ready to represent the former manager‚Äôs perspective. 
<br>
    
Key messages to keep in mind as you prepare for the Rewards Discussion: 

* Understand the outcome and **own the message** - watch [Owning Rewards Discussions](https://github.rewatch.com/video/phvvn4uain9h94o8-manager-training-owning-rewards-discussions?t=0) created by Microsofot for some great tips.
* Acknowledge that rewards **outcomes vary each year**
* **Respect** each individual and provide a **clear message** to them
* Be **specific and honest,** and reinforce great **impact** and where they can **grow**  

<br>

### Discussing the Rewards Outcome üë•

Before each Rewards Discussion plan on how you'd like the convesation to unfold. Listen to understand and invite participation - encourage conversation through open-ended questions. Pause to create space for your employee to share their perspective. Also, embrace the silence - silence can be an important time for your Hubber to think and reflect before asking questions or sharing how they feel.
<br>


Keep the following in mind:

- [ ] **Set Up the Discussion:** The approach to the discussion is critical since a rewards discussion is a moment that matters.  Regardless of the message, role model our culture, leadership principles and our commitment to diversity, inclusion and belonging.
- [ ] **Express Gratitude:** Even in situations where you expect a difficult conversation, make sure to express gratitude for the impact delivered this past cycle.
- [ ] **Practice Inclusive Behaviors:** Unconscious bias is a quick and often inaccurate judgement based on limited facts and our own life experiences. We all have unconscious bias, but can be more aware by keeping the following in mind: 
* Examine your assumptions
* Make a habit of asking questions
* Listen carefully to the employee until they feel understood
- [ ] **Set the Context:** Describe the process and rationale behind rewards to ensure you have a shared understanding of how impact was determined
- [ ] **Use the [Determining Impact](https://github.com/PeopleManagers/managers/blob/master/manager-toolkit/Assets/Impact%20Circles.png)** framework to talk about their impact
- [ ] **Transition into the rewards discussion:** ‚ÄúIn recognition of the impact you‚Äôve had this past year, you‚Äôve earned the following rewards...‚Äù
- [ ] **Thank the Hubber:** Talk about the Hubber‚Äôs opportunity for impact in the upcoming year

And as always, be mindful of your language: 

| When thinking about... | Avoid Saying | Instead, say‚Ä¶ |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | 
| Framing their impact related to rewards | You‚Äôre a rock star  | You had higher impact - both in results and behavior |
| Using ‚Äúrelative‚Äù language | You showed ‚Äòx‚Äô impact compared to your peers | Based on your opportunity for impact, your rewards are ‚Äòx‚Äô |
| Terminology | 160% payout | Higher immpact |
| Owning your influence in the process | If it was up to me‚Ä¶ | As managers, we discussed what high impact looks like across the org and I made a recommendation |

### Navigating Expectations üß≠ 

Anticipate your Hubbers reward expectations.

### Scenarios & Questions You May Encounter ‚ùî

Consider questions each of your Hubbers may ask - think about questions from their point of view. Prepare your answers.
<br>

<details><summary><strong>I‚Äôve been working more but my rewards don‚Äôt seem to reflect that - why?</strong></summary>
<br>


**Directional Guidance:**
    <br>
* Express care, acknowledging that the circumstances of this unprecedented year have impacted all of us in different ways.<br>
* Seek to understand your employee‚Äôs perspective and acknowledge the extra effort to manage work and life priorities this year.<br>
* Ground the conversation in impact (vs. activity) over the measurement period.<br> 

**Potential Talking Points:**
* ‚ÄúI want you to know that I value your work and extra effort during this exceptionally challenging time."<br>
* ‚ÄúI'm really grateful that you were able to continue to deliver on what we prioritized for the period.‚Äù<br>
* ‚ÄúI know we all had to work differently this year. Yet we continue to operate in a high-performing environment with high expectations. Would it help if I share some themes of what higher impact looked like this cycle?‚Äù


</details>

<details><summary><strong>I had to split time taking care of my children/family while trying to deliver on my goals - did this influence my rewards?</strong></summary>
<br>

**Directional Guidance:**
    <br>
* Express care by acknowledging your employee‚Äôs situation but avoid making assumptions about how caring for kids/family may have impacted their work.<br>
* Reinforce that rewards are based on impact in moving the business forward and are not a judgment on how much or how little you were able to work.<br>
* Reference LT messages that prioritized taking care of ourselves and our families.<br>
* Look forward to the period ahead, discuss collective priorities and how you can help your direct report be successful.
<br>
    
**Potential Talking Points:**
* ‚ÄúI know that you‚Äôve had a lot to balance over the past few months and I value all that you have been able to do for the business during this time. I considered your impact for the measurement period when recommending rewards.‚Äù<br>
* ‚ÄúWhen determining your impact, I considered how we prioritized your deliverables and what impact you were able to drive as a result.‚Äù<br>
* ‚ÄúKnowing that things continue to be uncertain, let‚Äôs discuss priorities for the period ahead and how I can best support you.‚Äù  

</details>

<details><summary><strong>Did I receive a low rewards outcome this year because of Covid-19?</strong></summary>
<br>

**Directional Guidance:**
    <br>
* Receiving a lower rewards outcome (e.g., zero rewards, or zero/lower stock) can be difficult to process, but even in these unique times, we can‚Äôt delay or avoid tough conversations.<br>
* Be clear that this outcome reflects the employee‚Äôs impact for the year and only time worked (e.g if they had a LOA).,br>
* Listen with empathy to any reactions they might have. <br>
* Show care by being direct and specific when communicating your expectations going forward.
<br>
    
**Potential Talking Points:**
* ‚ÄúI know that you‚Äôve had a lot to balance over the past few months and I value all that you have been able to do for the business during this time. I considered your impact for the full fiscal year when recommending rewards.‚Äù<br>
* ‚ÄúWhen determining your impact, I considered how we prioritized your deliverables and what impact you were able to drive as a result.‚Äù<br>
* ‚ÄúKnowing that things continue to be uncertain, let‚Äôs discuss priorities for the period ahead and how I can best support you.‚Äù<br>


</details>

<details><summary><strong>My work/project was de-prioritized or cancelled - did this impact my rewards?</strong></summary>
<br>

**Directional Guidance:**
    <br>
* Express empathy, acknowledging that shifts in priorities may have affected opportunity for impact post-COVID-19.<br>
* Provide specific examples of impact that were part of your employee‚Äôs work prior to the delay/cancellation.<br>
* Share examples of impact from deliverables that were prioritized when work shifted. This emphasizes that work may change, but there is still opportunity for impact.<br>

**Potential Talking Points:**
* ‚ÄúWe had to prioritize to respond to what‚Äôs happening globally, and that‚Äôs always a challenge. For work that was delayed/cancelled, know that I considered the contributions you made prior to the delay/cancellation since you had impact throughout the project ‚Äì milestones, partnerships, innovation, etc.‚Äù<br>
* ‚ÄúKnow that I determined your impact relative to the opportunity that you had, including impact you had during the project that was delayed/cancelled and any new work you took on when priorities changed.‚Äù<br>
* ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs review your core priorities going forward so they are aligned to our highest priorities for the business where possible, and so you‚Äôre set up for success.‚Äù
    

</details>

<details><summary><strong>I took a leave of absence this year - how does that impact my rewards?</strong></summary>
<br>
    
**Directional Guidance:**
* Reinforce that our #1 priority is the safety and well-being of our employees and their families.<br>
* Express care, empathy, and gratitude when acknowledging any significant changes to an employee‚Äôs situation.<br>


**Potential Talking Points:**
* ‚ÄúI am grateful that you took time away to prioritize your safety/well-being.‚Äù<br>
* ‚ÄúI considered your impact for the active time you worked over the full fiscal year and not for the time when you were away on leave."<br>
* ‚ÄúI appreciate the time and effort that you put into this year. I recognize the challenges you worked through to continue to deliver for the team/company.‚Äù<br>
